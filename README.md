I modified the project structure. Please see my structureOfReportSystem.pdf. 

I implemented all the apis in my structureOfReportSystem. I tested all the apis and the exception handlering. The delete and deltedExcepetion tests failed in APITest, but I tested in postman, it should be work. 

Please review my code! I really appreciate you for your review and feedback.



At least send me an email instead of just sending me an invitation.
Issues
Controller is calling repository. check the ExcelReportSystem.pdf for the structure.
Too many comment out makes the code look like a draft version and code format.
Junk testing data in the repo.
